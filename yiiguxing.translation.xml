      <item value="TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks (&quot;_&quot;). Then you can tell the user they've won." />

      <item value="TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with &quot;_&quot;." />
      <item value="If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position. e.g. If the user guessed &quot;p&quot; and the chosen word was &quot;apple&quot;, then display should be [&quot;_&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, &quot;_&quot;]." />

      <item value="So if the chosen_word was &quot;apple&quot;, display should be [&quot;_&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, &quot;_&quot;] with 5 &quot;_&quot; representing each letter to guess." />
